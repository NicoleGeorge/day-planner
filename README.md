Brief:
Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
You'll need to use the Moment.js library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.


Objective:
An employee, with a busy schedule, needs to be able to add important events to a daily workday planner, enabling them to manage their time effectively.

- When the user opens the app, the current day and date will appear in the header
- To store user information;
    > User clicks into the middle input field to type in their event.

- A user can still access the app via their mobile device
    > the UI is just as user friendly as the desktop version
